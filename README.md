BlockAid is a decentralised crowdfunding platform that allows users and charities to raise money for their causes. This is designed to help fundraisers widen their range of donors. An aim of the project is to investigate the resources and technologies available to developers to integrate, and several different packages 

The process and findings can be read in the attached thesis [here](https://github.com/IADT-projects/y4-project-patrickcarmody/blob/master/Docs/Patrick%20Carmody%20Final%20Thesis.pdf).

  

Ethereum Smart Contracts are used to facilitate donations and withdrawals, making the platform decentralised. Smart Contracts are programs that run on Ethereum-based blockchains, and have a variety of uses.

  

BlockAid is a MERN stack application which utilises ethers.js and wagmi to connect to the Polygon Mumbai Test Network and interact with crowdfunding smart contracts deployed when a fundraiser is created.
