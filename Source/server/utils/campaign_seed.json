        "description": "We have hundreds of puppies and dogs of all shapes, sizes, colours and breeds in our care, looking for their special someone. All puppies and dogs in our rehoming centre are neutered (or if not already neutered at the time of adoption, they will go home with a â‚¬90 voucher to be redeemed against the cost of neutering at a local veterinary practice), microchipped, fully vaccinated and have their temperament assessed before going to their Forever Home. Dogs Trust also offers a lifetime of training and behavioural support for all dogs and puppies rehomed from our centre. Dogs Trust does not receive any Government funding towards our life saving work, so none of this would be possible without the continued commitment and generosity of our donors and supporters. We simply could not continue our efforts without them.",

        "description": "Food, Water, Shelter, and Medical Services are the four basic immediate concerns in a hurricane or other emergency situation to safeguard people. Preventing injury and loss of life from storm-tossed debris, electrocution, exposure, or being caught in floodwaters are priorities for first responders and emergency personnel during a hurricane. Evacuations relate to geographic areas. But evacuating can be difficult for some. People who lack mobility or have other disabling physical or mental conditions have greater difficulty simply leaving their residences, as do those without transportation or with very low incomes.",
